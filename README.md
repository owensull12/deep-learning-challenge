# Deep Learning Challenge Analysis

The goal of this project is to predict whether applicants will be funded by "Alphabet Soup," a nonexistent nonprofit foundation. This README explains the differences in data preprocessing, model creation, and results between the basic deep learning model and my optimized version. The notebooks were written using Google Colab.

## Data Preprocessing
- The 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column is the target for this learning model. It has a binary output - either the applicant is funded or they are not.
- In the first model, found in [the basic model](deep_learning_challenge.ipynb),
